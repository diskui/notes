`cin` is an object of `istream`, and `cout` is an object of `ostream`.

there are two other `ostream` object in the `iostream` library: `cerr` and `clog`, the former is used for warning and error messages and the latter is used for general information of the execution of the program.

when using `print` to debug, programers must be sure that the `print` statement must flush the buffer.
