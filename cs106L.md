the content in the `cout` stream will not appear in the screen immediately, instead they will be stored in a buffer, and the `endl` in c++ is actually a new line character plus a **flush operator**.

don't mix `getline` and `cin` function, for `getline` won't skip the white character when begining to read while `cin` will.

you can't use `auto` as a parameter (unless in the lambda function).

when using vector, the `at` function will check the `out of bound` exception, but `[]` operator won't (just like array).

the `get` function of `map` will raise a error if the key we are looking for doesn't exist while `[]` notation will add a key with default value instead.

`++i` is sometimes faster than, and is never slower than `i++`.

some notations when iterate from a range:
![iterator from a range](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shelinfff/picpool/main/iteratorFromRange.png)

c **doesn't** support overloading.

to make an iterator read-only, one should define a const_iterator:
```c++
const vector<int>::iterator itr =v.begin();
*itr = 5; // OK! change what the itr is pointing to 
++itr; // BAD! can't modify itr

vector<int>::const_iterator itr = v.begin(); // a read-only iterator
*itr = 5; //BAD! can't change the value of itr
++itr; //OK change the itr itself
int value = *itr; //OK read the value from the itr
```

the `this` keyword in a class is a pointer pointing to the object itself.

a `friend` is a function outside a class but can access the varible in the class.

to initialize a const varible of the class in contructor functoin, one should put them in a initializatoin list:
```c++
StringVector::StringVector():logicalSize(0),allocatedSize(kInitSize){
    ...
}
```

when casting, using `static_cast` is considered best practice.
