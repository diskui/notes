### basic and strings

to see the return value of the program that just ran, one can use `echo $?`

there are two ways to include a file in c++: one is to use brackets and another is to use quotation mark, the difference between them is:

the brackets method is used to include a c++ system library while the other one is used to include a local project library, and the latter is usually used with ".h".

```c++
#include <libraryname>
#include "libraryname.h"
```

the namespace is an area for scoping identifiers, and the **using** statement can bring symbols from a library's "name space" into the global scope of your progam so you can refer to them.

in c++ you can pass any data type through value semantic or reference semantic.

c **doesn't** support pass by reference.

pass by value: when a parameter is passed into a function, the new varible stores a copy of the passed in value in memory

pass by reference: when a parameter is passed into a function, the new varible stores a reference to the passed in value, which allows you to directly edit the original value

if you only want to output one thing you should use return statement while if you want to output many things you should use reference semantic.

you can't provide a literal as an argument if you are passing a parameter by reference:
```c++
void tripleWeight(double& wight_ref);
...
tripleWeight(1.06) // error
```

the character of a string can be accessed using `[index]`  or `at`:  
```c++
char b = s[1];
char c = s.at(1);
```

strings are mutable in c++

the strings in the double quotation are default to **c strings** which don't supprot "+" operaors. (c strings have no methods at all)

```c++
string c = "a" + "b"; //error
string a = "a";
string b = "b";
string c = a + b; // correct
```
to fix this issue, one can convert a c string to c++ string by using a conversion function:
```c++
string("text) : converts a c string to c++ string
string.c_str() :  return a c string from a c++ string

string a = "a"; // c++ string stored to variable a
string b = a.c_str(); // c string
```

or just store a c string into a varible, which will converts it to c++ string

you will get a garbage value if you add a c string to a character:
```c++
string hiThere = "hi" + '?';
cout << hiThere << endl; //garbage
```
the upper function which convert a character to upper case will return a int (which can be cast into char implicitly)

if you want a function to modify a vector you should pass it by reference.

struct is a way to bundle different types of information in C++ - like creating a custom data structure

unlike with queues, you can't iterate over a stack without destroying it, so when you want to iterate it, copy it first.

the auto-insertion only happens with the [] operator, not the .get() function

when you use the [] operator to access an element from a map, you get a reference to the map, which means that any changes you make to the reference will be persistent in the map.

however, when you use the = operator to assign the result of the [] operator to a varible, you got a copy of the internal data structure.

const reference:

pass a reference to a function but **don't allow to modify** the value:

```c++
void proofreadLongEssay(const string& essay){
    /* can read, but not change, the essay */
}
```

the difference between dot(.) and arrow(->) operations:

* the Dot(.) operator is used to normally access members of a structure or union.

* the Arrow(->) operator exists to access the members of the structure or the unions using pointers.
