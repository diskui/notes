## Introction

the primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.

goals of database system:
* define data structure to munipulate information
* keep the data safe

the central aspect of the application is not a program performing some calculation, but rather the data themselves.

Database systems are used to manage collections of data that:
* are highly valuable,
* are relatively large, and
* are accessed by multiple users and applications, often at the same time.

to deal with the complexity : use abstration.

two modes which databases are used:
* online transaction processing: many users use the database, fecthing a small amout of data
* data analytics

data model: a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints.

some different data models:
* relational model : use tables to represent both data and the relationships among these data. also named records-based model
* entity-relationship(E-R) model: use a collection of entities and relations, being used widely in database design
* semi-structured data model : individual data items of the same type may have different sets of attributes.
* object-based data model: as entending the relational model with encapsulation, methods, and object identity.

several levels of data abstrcaion:
* physical level: describe how the data are actually stored
* logical level: describe what data are stored in the database, and what relationships exist among the data.
* view level: describe only part of the entire database.

The collection of information stored in the database at a particular moment is called an instance of the database. The overall design of the database is called the database schema.

A database system provides a data-definition language (DDL) to specify the database schema and a data-manipulation language (DML) to express database queries and updates.

the functional components of a database system:
* storage manager
* query processor component
* transaction management component

the database system structure the data so as to minimize the need to move data between disk and main memory.

the join operation allows us to combine a selection and a Cartesian product into a single operation.
