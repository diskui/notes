## overview

interpreters will execute all the code, receive the data and get the result, while compiler will receive the code and **compile** it to a executable program, which will receive data and get the result when running.

interpreter is on line, compiler is off line.

interpreter is usually slower than a compiler。

the structure of compiler:
* lexical analysis
* parsing
* semantic analysis
* optimization
* code generation

meaning is **many to one** so meaning function can do some optimization

## lexical analysis

the goal of lexical analysis is to split the sentense to words(token)

"lookahead" may be required to decide when a token ends

five regular expressions constructs:
* empty: epsilon
* single char: 'c'
* union: A+B
* concatenation: A*B
* iteration: A* A...A

epsilon(ε) is not an empty set, but a set with a single, empty string

regular expression is a notation of regular language.

expression is syntax, and language is a map from expression to a set of string.

ε -> {""}

'c' -> {"c"}

regular expression is the specification of lexical structure, and finite automata is the implementation of regular expression.

a finite automata consists of:
* an input alphabet Σ
* a set of state S
* a start state n
* a set of accepting state F ⊆ S
* a set of transitions

the difference between DFA and NFA is that NFA can have epsilon-move.

NFA to DFA:

the NFA states are a subset of DFA states.

the start states are ε(starts)

the final states are X when X ∩ F != Ø

## parsing
parsing: to analysis the structure of a sentense and do some abstraction

programing language construts have recursive structure, context-free grammers are a nature notation for this recurcive structure

in cool, an expr is:

```
if expr then expr else expr fi

while expr loop expr pool
```

a CFG consists of:
* a set of terminal T
* a set of non terminal N
* a start symbol S (a non terminal)
* a set of productions

a grammer is ambiguous if it has more than one parse tree for some strings.

there is no general techniques for handling ambiguity, and it's impossible to convert a ambiguous grammer to an unambiguous one.

(sometimes ambiguity can simplify the problem with careful usage)

one way to deal with ambiguity is to rewrite the grammer to give it a precedence (and associativity).

compute the first set:
* First(t) = {t}
* ε ∈ First(X)
    * if X -> ε or
    * if X -> A1...An and ε ∈ First(Ai) for all 1 <= i <= n
* First(α) ∈ First(X)
    * if X -> α or
    * if X -> A1...Anα and ε ∈ First(Ai) fol all 1 <= i <= n

compute follow set:
* $ ∈ Follow(S)
* for each production A -> αXβ
    * First(β) - {ε} ∈ Follow(X)
* for each production A -> αXβ where ε ∈ First(β)
    * Follow(A) ∈ Folllow(X)

### top-down parsing
construct a parsing table T for CFG G:
* for each production A → α in G do:
    * for each terminal t ∈ First(α) do
        * T[A, t] = α
     * If ε ∈ First(α), then for each t ∈ Follow(A) do
        * T[A, t] = α
    * If ε ∈ First(α) and $ ∈ Follow(A) do
        * T[A, $] = α

### bottom-up parsing
bottom-up parsers don't need left-factored grammers (which top-down parsers do).

a bottom-up parser traces a rightmost derivation in reverse

therefore there comes a fact of bottom-up parser:

Let αβω be a step of a bottom-up parse
* Assume the next reduction is by X→ β
* Then ω is a string of terminals

we want to reduce only if the result can still be reduced to the start symbol.

what is a handle:

Assume a rightmost derivation

S →* αXω → αβω

Then X → β in the position after α is a handle of αβω

we can and must reduce at handles.

In shift-reduce parsing, handles appear only at the
top of the stack, never inside

the | never move left during the bottom-up parsing

what is viable prefix:

α is a viable prefix if there is an ω such that α|ω is a state of a shift-reduce parser

For any grammar, the set of viable prefixes is a regular language

## semantic analysis
semantic analysis: to understand the meaning, but it is too hard so the compilers can only do limited semantic analysis: to catch the inconsistency
